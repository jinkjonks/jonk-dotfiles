Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! This repository contains configuration files for various applications and tools I use on my machine. The setup is managed using GNU Stow for easy symlink management.

## Installation

To get started with my dotfiles, clone the repository and use GNU Stow to manage the symlinks:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Drucial/dotfiles.git
   cd dotfiles
   ```

2. **Install GNU Stow** (if not already installed):
   - On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install stow
     ```
   - On macOS (using Homebrew):
     ```bash
     brew install stow
     ```

3. **Symlink the Configurations**:
   Use Stow to create symlinks for the configuration you want to use. For example, to set up your Neovim configuration:

   ```bash
   stow nvim
   ```

   This command will symlink the contents of the `nvim` directory to your home directory.

4. **Repeat for Other Configurations**:
   You can repeat the stow command for other configurations like `alacritty`, `zsh`, `tmux`, etc.:
   ```bash
   stow alacritty
   stow zsh
   ```

## Syncing to Another Computer

To sync your dotfiles on another computer, follow these steps:

   Make sure `git` and `stow` are installed on the new machine. You can install them using your package manager as shown in the installation section above.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open a terminal on the new computer and clone your dotfiles repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Drucial/dotfiles.git
   cd dotfiles
   ```

3. **Symlink the Configurations**:
   Use Stow to set up the configurations you need. For example:

   stow nvim
   stow zsh
   ```

4. **Customize as Needed**:
   You can edit any configuration files to make machine-specific adjustments if necessary.

5. **Pull Updates**:
   If you make changes to your dotfiles on one machine and push them to GitHub, you can update the other machine by navigating to the dotfiles directory and running:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```
